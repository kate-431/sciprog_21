*READ ME*

Week 5 practical codes include:
1. scan.c
2. fibo.c
3. arctan.c

**INFORMATION ON PROGRAMS**

The scan.c program is used to demonstrate the use of the function scan in C programs.
The Fibonacci.c program is used to calculate the Fibonacci sequence for an integer.        
The arctan.c program is used to calculate the arctan using a MacLauren series and using the natural log.

**HOW TO COMPILE THE PROGRAMS**


To Compile the programs above in a BASH environment, the following command must be used; gcc. Folled by -o which allows us to rename the program for when running it.

**EXAMPLE**

To compile program:
gcc -o scan scan.c

To run the compiled program:
./scan


*Note*

The code arctan.c will require the command -lm when compiling to use the math library when compiling.
