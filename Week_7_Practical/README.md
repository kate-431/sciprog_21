Week 7 practical codes include:
1. mem_alloc.c 
2. polynomial.c


**INFORMATION ON PROGRAMS**

The mem_alloc.c program demonstrates allocating memory and deallocating memory.
The polynomial.c program is used to calculate e using the polynomial equation and comparing it to the true value.

**HOW TO COMPILE THE PROGRAMS**


To Compile the programs above in a BASH environment, the following command must be used; gcc. Folled by -o which allows us to rename the program for when running it.

**EXAMPLE**

To compile program:
gcc -o poly polynomial.c

To run the compiled program:
./poly
